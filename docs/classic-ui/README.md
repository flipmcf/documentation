# Plone Classic UI Docs

- All documentation should be written in Markdown.
- If possible, please structure into dirs, this will make it easier to build a structure later.

See the following example

```markdown
/docs
➜ tree
.
├── deploy.md
├── index.md
└── install.md
```
Use a file called `index.md` for creating an index (if needed)

```shell
➜ cat index.md
install.md
deploy.md
```

Thank you!!
