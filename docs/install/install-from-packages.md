# Install Plone from its packages
 
When you want full control over development or deployment, installing Plone from its packages is a good option.


(install-packages-system-requirements-label)=

## System requirements

The hardware requirements below give a rough estimate of the minimum hardware setup needed for a Plone server.

Add-on products and caching solutions may increase RAM requirements.

A single Plone installation is able to run many Plone sites.
You may host multiple Plone sites on the same server.

-   Almost any modern operating system, including Linux, macOS, and Windows, but a UNIX-based operating system is recommended.
-   Minimum 256 MB RAM and 512 MB of swap space per Plone site is required.
    2 GB or more RAM per Plone site is recommended.
-   Minimum 512 MB hard disk space is required.
    40 GB or more hard disk space is recommended.


(install-packages-prerequisites-label)=

### Pre-requisites for installation

-   Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10.
-   Cookiecutter
-   Node.JS
-   nvm
-   Yeoman
-   Yarn
-   GNU make

Installing Python is beyond the scope of this documentation.
However, it is recommended to use a Python version manager, [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) that allows you to install multiple versions of Python on your development environment without destroying your system's Python.

Install or upgrade {term}`Cookiecutter` in your user's Python:

```shell
pip install --user --upgrade cookiecutter
```

{ref}`Install nvm and Node.js documentation <frontend-getting-started-install-nvm-label>`.

{ref}`Install Yeoman documentation <frontend-getting-started-yeoman-label>`.

{ref}`Install Yarn documentation <frontend-getting-started-yarn-label>`.

{term}`Make` comes installed on most Linux distributions.
On macOS, you must first [install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/), then install its command line tools.
On Windows, it is strongly recommended to [Install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which will include `make`.

## Install Plone 6

We install Plone 6 with {term}`pip`, {term}`Cookiecutter`, {term}`mxdev`, {term}`make`, and other developer tools.

```{note}
We do not maintain documentation for installing Plone 6 or later with `buildout`.
For Plone 5, `buildout` was the preferred installation method.
You can read the [documentation of how to install Plone 5 with `buildout`](https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installation_minimal_buildout.html), and adapt it to your needs for Plone 6.
```

Create a new directory to hold your project, and make it your current directory.

```shell
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
```

Run `cookiecutter` to create a Plone project skeleton using the Cookiecutter {term}`cookiecutter-plone-starter` with the following command.

```shell
cookiecutter https://github.com/collective/cookiecutter-plone-starter
```

You will be presented with a series of prompts.
You can accept the default values in square brackets (`[default-option]`) by hitting the {kbd}`Enter` key, or enter your preferred values.
For ease of documentation, we will use the default values.

Summary:
  - Plone version: 6.0.0b2
  - Volto version: 16.0.0-alpha.35
  - Output folder: /<path-to-project>/my_project/project-title

Frontend codebase:
 - Install latest @plone/generator-volto
 - Generate frontend application with @plone/volto 16.0.0-alpha.35

Backend codebase
 - Format generated code in the backend
================================================================================

Project "Project Title" was generated

Now, code it, create a git repository, push to your organization.

Sorry for the convenience,
The Plone Community.

================================================================================
```

Change to your project directory {file}`project-title`.

```shell
cd project-title
```

Next we switch to using `make`.
To see all available commands and their descriptions, enter the following command.

```shell
make help
```

To install both the Plone backend and frontend, use the following command.

```shell
make install
```

This will take a few minutes.
‚òïÔ∏è
First the backend, then the frontend will be installed.
At the start of the frontend installation part, you might see a prompt.

```console
Need to install the following packages:
  mrs-developer
Ok to proceed? (y)
``` 

Hit the {kbd}`Enter` key to proceed and install `mrs-developer`.

When the process completes successfully, it will exit with a message similar to the following.

```console
‚ú®  Done in 98.97s.
```

## Start Plone

Plone 6 has two servers: one for the frontend, and one for the backend.
As such, we need to maintain two active shell sessions, one for each server, to start your Plone site.


(install-packages-start-plone-backend-label)=

### Start Plone backend

In the currently open session, issue the following command.

```shell
make start-backend
```

The Plone backend server starts up and emits messages to the console.

```console
2022-09-24 01:30:17,799 WARNING [ZODB.FileStorage:411][MainThread] Ignoring index for /<path-to-project>/my_project/project-title/backend/instance/var/filestorage/Data.fs

(install-packages-start-plone-frontend-label)=

### Start Plone frontend

Create a second shell session in a new window.
Change your current working directory to {file}`project-title`.
Start the Plone frontend with the following command.

```shell
make start-frontend
```

The Plone frontend server starts up and emits messages to the console.

```console
yarn run v1.22.19
$ razzle start
 WAIT  Compiling...


‚úî Client
  Compiled successfully in 864.83ms

‚úî Server
  Compiled successfully in 9.62s

‚úÖ  Server-side HMR Enabled!
Volto is running in SEAMLESS mode
Using internal proxy: http://localhost:3000 -> http://localhost:8080/Plone
üé≠ Volto started at 0.0.0.0:3000 üöÄ
```

Note that the Plone frontend uses an internal proxy server to connect with the Plone backend.
Open a browser at the following URL to visit your Plone site.

http://localhost:3000

You will see a page similar to the following.

```{image} /_static/plone-home-page.png
:alt: Plone home page
:class: figure
```

Select the {guilabel}`Login` link to visit the login form, and enter the following credentials.

-   {guilabel}`Login name`: `admin`
-   {guilabel}`Password`: `admin`

```{image} /_static/plone-login-page.png
:alt: Plone login page
:class: figure
```

Now you can edit content or configure your Plone site.

You can stop the site with {kbd}`ctrl-c`.

Enjoy!
